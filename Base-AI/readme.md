# Smart Contract Project

This project consists of a set of smart contracts designed for a decentralized employment and identity platform. It includes functionality for worker registration, job creation, and AI-based worker matching.

## Contracts Overview

- **Security_MetaTasker**: Handles security features for the other contracts.
- **MultiSigWalletFactory**: Manages multi-signature wallets for job contracts.
- **WorkerInfo_MetaTasker**: Registers workers and their skillsets.
- **AICanister**: Performs AI-based operations for worker matching and score prediction.

## Requirements

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- npm (Node Package Manager)
- Hardhat
- A local Ethereum network (like Hardhat Network or Ganache)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

### Local Development

1. **Start a local Ethereum network:**

   ```bash
   npx hardhat node
   ```

2. **Deploy the contracts:**

   Open another terminal window and run:

   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
   ```

### Running Tests

To test the smart contracts, use the following command:

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/test.js --network localhost
```

This will deploy the contracts and run the test script to verify their functionality.

## Script Descriptions

### `scripts/deploy.js`

- Deploys the `Security_MetaTasker`, `MultiSigWalletFactory`, `WorkerInfo_MetaTasker`, and `AICanister` contracts.
- Outputs the addresses of deployed contracts to the console.

### `scripts/test.js`

- Tests the functionality of the deployed contracts by:
  - Registering a worker
  - Creating a job
  - Predicting the worker's score for the job
  - Finding the best match for the job

# Project Overview: Decentralized Employment and Identity Platform

## Introduction

The **Decentralized Employment and Identity Platform** is designed to revolutionize the way workers find jobs and employers hire talent. By leveraging blockchain technology, this platform provides a secure, transparent, and efficient means of matching skilled workers with job opportunities. It aims to eliminate intermediaries, reduce costs, and improve the overall hiring experience for both workers and employers.

## Objectives

1. **Worker Registration**: Allow workers to register on the platform, providing their skills and experience.
2. **Job Creation**: Enable employers to create job listings that outline requirements and responsibilities.
3. **AI-Driven Matching**: Implement AI algorithms for scoring workers based on their qualifications relative to job requirements.
4. **Multi-Signature Wallets**: Use multi-signature wallets to ensure secure transactions and approvals for job-related payments.
5. **Decentralized Identity Management**: Provide a decentralized way to manage worker identities and qualifications, enhancing privacy and security.

## Features

- **Worker Registration**: Workers can register by providing their experience and skill level, which is stored securely on the blockchain.
- **Job Listings**: Employers can create jobs with specific requirements for experience and skills.
- **Predictive Matching**: The platform uses linear regression to predict the suitability of workers for jobs based on their registered data.
- **Multi-Sig Security**: Each job is associated with a multi-signature wallet that requires multiple approvals for any fund transfers, enhancing security.
- **Transparent Applications**: Workers can apply for jobs, and their applications are stored on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and traceability.

## Architecture

### Components

1. **AICanister**: This smart contract implements the core functionality for worker registration, job creation, and predictive scoring. It interacts with the `WorkerInfo_MetaTasker` and `MultiSigWalletFactory` contracts to retrieve worker and job data.

2. **WorkerInfo_MetaTasker**: Manages worker data, including their skills and wallet addresses. It allows for easy registration and retrieval of worker information.

3. **MultiSigWalletFactory**: Creates and manages multi-signature wallets for job contracts. It ensures that job-related funds can only be accessed through multi-signature approvals, enhancing security.

4. **Security_MetaTasker**: Implements security features that protect the overall system, ensuring that only authorized users can perform sensitive operations.

### Workflow

1. **Registration**: Workers register on the platform by providing their details. This information is stored in the `WorkerInfo_MetaTasker` contract.
   
2. **Job Creation**: Employers create job listings specifying requirements, which are stored in the `MultiSigWalletFactory`.

3. **Matching Process**: The `AICanister` contract calculates a score for each worker based on their experience and skills compared to job requirements. This score is derived using a linear regression model.

4. **Job Applications**: Workers can apply for jobs, and their applications are stored in the `MultiSigWalletFactory`, ensuring that all actions are recorded on the blockchain.

5. **Payment Approval**: Payments for jobs are processed through multi-signature wallets, requiring approval from multiple parties, thereby adding a layer of trust and security.

## Technology Stack

- **Solidity**: For smart contract development.
- **Hardhat**: For Ethereum development, testing, and deployment.
- **Ethereum Network**: As the underlying blockchain platform for deploying the contracts.

## Future Enhancements

1. **AI Integration**: Implement more advanced AI models for improved matching and scoring based on additional features.
2. **User Interface**: Develop a user-friendly frontend to facilitate worker and employer interactions.
3. **Decentralized Identity**: Explore integrations with decentralized identity solutions to enhance worker identity verification.

## Conclusion

This platform aims to create a fair, transparent, and efficient job market by leveraging blockchain technology. By removing intermediaries and providing a secure way to connect workers and employers, it has the potential to transform the employment landscape.
